Analyzing Global Happiness Trends During Economic Crises
Overview: This project explores the impact of economic crises, specifically the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, on national happiness levels. Using data from the World Happiness Report, we investigated how various socio-economic factors, including GDP per capita, social support, and freedom to make life choices, influence happiness scores across different economic periods.
Key Objectives:
* Assess the relationship between social support, economic prosperity, and subjective well-being.
* Examine how happiness trends differ between high and low GDP countries during stable periods and times of crisis.
* Quantify the interaction effects of economic downturns on happiness determinants using multiple regression models.
Methods & Tools:
* Data Cleaning & Processing: Pandas, NumPy
* Statistical Analysis: OLS Regression (Statsmodels)
* Data Visualization: Altair (heatmaps, scatterplots with regression lines)
* Feature Engineering: Created categorical indicators for economic periods (Recession, COVID-19, and Other) and economic status (High vs. Low GDP).
Findings:
* GDP and happiness are strongly correlated, but the COVID-19 pandemic showed a unique pattern where low-GDP countries had higher-than-expected happiness scores.
* The Great Recession had a greater negative impact on happiness in high-GDP countries, suggesting economic stability plays a more significant role in these nations.
* Social support and freedom to make life choices remained key predictors of happiness, even during crises.
Conclusion: This study highlights the nuanced impact of global crises on happiness, demonstrating that economic downturns do not affect all countries uniformly. By leveraging regression models, we gained insights into how external shocks disrupt well-being, informing future policies for economic resilience and public well-being.
